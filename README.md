## Introduction

The Sobriety Tracker App is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help individuals track their sobriety journey. The app allows users to enter their sobriety start date and personal name, offering encouragement by displaying the number of days, months, or years they have remained sober. This app is very basic and is intended to be a learning tool for myself and others who are new to SwiftUI. I plan to add more features and improve the design in the future.

## Features

- **Personalized Greetings:** Users can input their name for personalized interactions with the app.
- **Sobriety Duration Tracking:** Calculates and displays the time elapsed since the sobriety start date.
- **Settings Page:** Allows users to update their start date and name or reset their information.
- **Privacy-Focused:** No personal data is stored externally, ensuring user privacy.
- **Mobile Compatibility:** Fully functional on iOS devices.
